# keepassxc-proxy-rust
Application that works as a proxy between Native Messaging browser extension and KeePassXC

This is still under development. Installing the proxy needs manual changes to JSON scripts installed for Native Messaging.
See [this page](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/nativeMessaging) for further information.

keepassxc-proxy listens stdin from keepassxc-browser extension and transfers the data to Unix domain socket `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` or `/tmp/org.keepassxc.KeePassXC.BrowserServer` which KeePassXC listens.
With Windows this is a named pipe under `org.keepassxc.KeePassXC.BrowserServer\<username>`.


## Building

The proxy can be built with:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Static library

To build a binary without dependencies (which is useful for running
inside of a flatpak), you'll have to install MUSL libc first:

```bash
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

Then build with

```bash
RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-s' cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```
